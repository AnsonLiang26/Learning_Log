# Learning_Log

This project is a web application that allows users to track their learning progress on a specific topic. These topics and reflections are user-specific and are logged in a SQLite database along with the userâ€™s login information. This project was created using Django and designed using Bootstrap. It was inspired by a software that I previously used called Managebac and from a project from the "Python Crash Course" book.
